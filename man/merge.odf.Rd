\title{Merge method for odf data.frames.}
\usage{
\method{merge}{odf}(
  x,
  y,
  by = NULL,
  by.x = NULL,
  by.y = NULL,
  all = FALSE,
  all.x = all,
  all.y = all,
  sort = TRUE,
  suffixes = c(".x", ".y"),
  no.dups = TRUE,
  allow.cartesian = getOption("datatable.allow.cartesian"),
  incomparables = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{odf data.frames, or objects to be coerced to one}

\item{by}{A vector of shared column names in x and y to merge on. This defaults to the
shared key columns between the two tables. If y has no key columns, this
defaults to the key of x.}

\item{by.x, by.y}{Vectors of column names in x and y to merge on.}

\item{all}{logical; all = TRUE is shorthand to save setting both all.x = TRUE and
all.y = TRUE.}

\item{all.x}{logical; if TRUE, rows from x which have no matching row in y are included.
These rows will have 'NA's in the columns that are usually filled with values
from y. The default is FALSE so that only rows with data from both x and y
are included in the output.}

\item{all.y}{logical; analogous to all.x above.}

\item{sort}{logical. If TRUE (default), the rows of the merged data.table are sorted by
setting the key to the by / by.x columns. If FALSE, unlike base R's merge for
which row order is unspecified, the row order in x is retained (including
retaining the position of missings when all.x=TRUE), followed by y rows that
don't match x (when all.y=TRUE) retaining the order those appear in y.}

\item{suffixes}{A character(2) specifying the suffixes to be used for making non-by column
names unique. The suffix behaviour works in a similar fashion as the
merge.data.frame method does.}

\item{no.dups}{logical indicating that suffixes are also appended to non-by.y column names
in y when they have the same column name as any by.x.}

\item{allow.cartesian}{See allow.cartesian in \code{\link{data.table}}.}

\item{incomparables}{values which cannot be matched and therefore are excluded from by columns.}

\item{...}{Not used at this time.}
}
\value{
A new odf data.frame build from the two input data.frames with the
variable attributes from the original data.frames. Sorted by the columns set
(or inferred for) the by argument if argument sort is set to TRUE.
For variables/columns occurring in both x and y, attributes are taken from x.
}
\description{
Merge two odf data.frames in R while keeping attributes with metadata.
}
\details{
\code{\link{merge}} is a generic function in base R. It dispatches to either the
merge.data.frame method, merge.odf or merge.data.table method depending on
the class of its first argument. merge.odf uses the merge.data.table to
join data.frame and adds the attributes containing metadata from the two
original odf data.frames.
Note that, unlike SQL join, NA is matched against NA (and NaN against NaN)
while merging.
For a more data.table-centric way of merging two data.tables, see
\code{\link{data.table}}. See FAQ 1.11 for a detailed comparison of
merge.

\examples{
# get path to example data from the opendataformat package (data.zip)
path  <-  system.file("extdata", "data.zip", package = "opendataformat")
# read four columns of example data specified as Open Data Format from ZIP file
df  <-  read_odf(file = path, select = 1:4)

# read other columns of example data specified as Open Data Format from ZIP file
df2  <-  read_odf(file = path, select = 4:7)

# generate a variable for joining both datasets:
df$id<-1:20
df2$id<-1:20

# merge both datasets by id column
merged_df<-merge(df, df2)

#merge both datasets by shared key columns between the two tables
merged_df2<-merge(df, df2)
